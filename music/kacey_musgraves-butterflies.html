        <p>
          I was just coasting, never really going anywhere
          <br>Caught up in a web, I was getting kind of use to staying there
          <br>And out of the blue
          <br>I fell for you
          <br>
          <br>Now you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down
          <br>Stealing my heart, 'stead of stealing my crown
          <br>Untangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied
          <br>I didn't know him and I didn't know me
          <br>Cloud nine, was always out of reach
          <br>Now I remember what it feels like to fly
          <br>You give me butterflies
          <br>
          <br>Kiss full of color, makes me wonder where you've always been
          <br>I was hiding in doubt, 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
          <br>And I came out new
          <br>All because of you
          <br>
          <br>Now you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down
          <br>Stealing my heart, 'stead of stealing my crown
          <br>Untangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied
          <br>I didn't know him and I didn't know me
          <br>Cloud nine, was always out of reach
          <br>Now I remember what it feels like to fly
          <br>You give me butterflies
          <br>Yeah, you give me butterflies
          <br>
          <br>Now you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down
          <br>You're taking my hand, 'stead of taking my crown
          <br>Untangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied
          <br>I didn't know him and I didn't know me
          <br>Cloud nine, was always out of reach
          <br>Now I remember what it feels like to fly
          <br>You give me butterflies, hmm
          <br>You give me butterflies
