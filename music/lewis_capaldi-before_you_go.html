        <p>
          I fell by the wayside like everyone else
          <br>I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
          <br>But I was just kidding myself
          <br>Our every moment, I start to replace
          <br>'Cause now that they're gone
          <br>All I hear were the words that I needed to say
          <br>
          <br>When you hurt under the surface
          <br>Like troubled water running cold
          <br>Well, time can heal but this won't
          <br>
          <br>So, before you go
          <br>Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
          <br>If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
          <br>So, before you go
          <br>Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
          <br>It kills me how your mind could make you feel so worthless
          <br>So, before you go
          <br>
          <br>Was never the right time whenever you called
          <br>Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
          <br>Our every moment, I start to replay
          <br>But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
          <br>
          <br>When you hurt under the surface
          <br>Like troubled water running cold
          <br>Well, time can heal but this won't
          <br>
          <br>So, before you go
          <br>Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
          <br>If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
          <br>So, before you go
          <br>Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
          <br>It kills me how your mind could make you feel so worthless
          <br>So, before you go
          <br>
          <br>Would we be better off by now
          <br>If I'd have let my walls come down
          <br>Maybe I guess we'll never know
          <br>You know
          <br>You know
          <br>
          <br>Before you go
          <br>Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
          <br>If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
          <br>So, before you go
          <br>Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
          <br>It kills me how your mind could make you feel so worthless
          <br>So, before you go
        </p>
