          I have never wished and hoped
          <br>Didn't need a telescope
          <br>To see where I am going
          <br>I have never been the one
          <br>Trying hard to hold my tongue
          <br>Is my stereo
          <br>
          <br>At one day I'll stand with a crown on my head
          <br>Like a God, yeah, like a God
          <br>With every step, no, I won't second guess what I want
          <br>
          <br>I wanna be like Kanye
          <br>I'll be the king of me always
          <br>Do what I want, I'll have it my way
          <br>All day like Kanye-eah, yeah, yeah
          <br>Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah
          <br>Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah
          <br>I'll be the king of me
          <br>
          <br>Born in broken home, okay
          <br>Single mama, let me chase what I was made for
          <br>We made out to Paradise,
          <br>Build on nickels, rubbing dimes
          <br>I'm entitled to so much more
          <br>
          <br>One day I'll stand with a crown on my head
          <br>Like a God, yeah, like a God
