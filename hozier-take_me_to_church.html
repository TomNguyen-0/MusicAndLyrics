My lover's got humor
<br>She's the giggle at a funeral
<br>Knows everybody's disapproval
<br>I should've worshiped her sooner
<br>If the Heavens ever did speak
<br>She's the last true mouthpiece
<br>Every Sunday's getting more bleak
<br>A fresh poison each week
<br>"We were born sick", you heard them say it
<br>My church offers no absolutes
<br>She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
<br>The only Heaven I'll be sent to
<br>Is when I'm alone with you
<br>I was born sick, but I love it
<br>Command me to be well
<br>A-, Amen, Amen, Amen
<br>
<br>Take me to church
<br>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
<br>I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
<br>Offer me that deathless death
<br>Good God, let me give you my life
<br>Take me to church
<br>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
<br>I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
<br>Offer me that deathless death
<br>Good God, let me give you my life
<br>
<br>If I'm a pagan of the good times
<br>My lover's the sunlight
<br>To keep the Goddess on my side
<br>She demands a sacrifice
<br>Drain the whole sea
<br>Get something shiny
<br>Something meaty for the main course
<br>That's a fine looking high horse
<br>What you got in the stable?
<br>We've a lot of starving faithful
<br>That looks tasty
<br>That looks plenty
<br>This is hungry work
<br>
<br>Take me to church
<br>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
<br>I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
<br>Offer me my deathless death
<br>Good God, let me give you my life
<br>Take me to church
<br>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
<br>I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
<br>Offer me my deathless death
<br>Good God, let me give you my life
<br>
<br>No masters or kings when the ritual begins
<br>There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
<br>In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
<br>Only then I am human
<br>Only then I am clean
<br>Oh, oh, Amen, Amen, Amen
<br>
<br>Take me to church
<br>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
<br>I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
<br>Offer me that deathless death
<br>Good God, let me give you my life
<br>Take me to church
<br>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
<br>I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
<br>Offer me that deathless death
<br>Good God, let me give you my life
