        <p>
            <br>Now I've heard there was a secret chord
            <br>That David played, and it pleased the Lord
            <br>But you don't really care for music, do you?
            <br>It goes like this the fourth, the fifth
            <br>The minor fall and the major lift
            <br>The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"
            <br>
            <br>Hallelujah, Hallelujah
            <br>Hallelujah, Hallelujah
            <br>
            <br>You say I took the name in vain
            <br>I don't even know the name
            <br>But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
            <br>There's a blaze of light in every word
            <br>It doesn't matter what you heard
            <br>The holy or the broken Hallelujah
            <br>
            <br>Hallelujah, Hallelujah
            <br>Hallelujah, Hallelujah
            <br>
            <br>I did my best, it wasn't much
            <br>I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
            <br>I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
            <br>And even though it all went wrong
            <br>I'll stand before the Lord of Song
            <br>With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
            <br>
            <br>Hallelujah, Hallelujah
            <br>Hallelujah, Hallelu-
            <br>Hallelujah, Hallelujah
            <br>Hallelujah, Hallelu-
            <br>Hallelujah
