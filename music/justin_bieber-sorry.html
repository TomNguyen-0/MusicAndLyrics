        <p>
          You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
          <br>You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
          <br>I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
          <br>'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
          <br>I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
          <br>By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
          <br>So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
          <br>'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
          <br>'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
          <br>Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
          <br>Yeah, I know that I let you down
          <br>Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>I'm sorry, yeah
          <br>Sorry, yeah
          <br>Sorry
          <br>Yeah, I know that I let you down
          <br>Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
          <br>But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
          <br>I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
          <br>Can we both say the words and forget this?
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
          <br>'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
          <br>Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
          <br>Yeah, I know that I let you down
          <br>Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
          <br>
          <br>[Bridge]
          <br>I'm not just trying to get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
          <br>'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
          <br>Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
          <br>Yeah, I know that I let you down
          <br>Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>I'm sorry, yeah
          <br>Sorry, oh
          <br>Sorry
          <br>Yeah I know that I let you down
          <br>Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
          <br>I'm sorry, yeah
          <br>Sorry, oh
          <br>Sorry
          <br>Yeah, I know that I let you down
          <br>Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
