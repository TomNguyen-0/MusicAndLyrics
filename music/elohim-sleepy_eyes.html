        <p>
          Look at me with your sleepy eyes
          <br>Ollie ollie oxen free, we don't have to hide
          <br>I just wanna touch your face
          <br>Take me straight to outer space
          <br>Come lay me with me in our treasure trove
          <br>Kids don't know what it's like to fall so far
          <br>
          <br>Cracking ya' code, nothing was chose
          <br>You were a stranger
          <br>Shifting the mode, breaking the mold
          <br>Where did the rain go?
          <br>
          <br>Kiss me with your eyes open
          <br>So you can see me when I'm melting
          <br>Kiss me with your eyes open
          <br>They dilate when you hold me close
          <br>Kiss me with your eyes open
          <br>
          <br>Sometimes I trip and think about the past
          <br>I end up falling down a dirty path
          <br>But you bring me back, put me on track
          <br>I’m being crazy
          <br>You took me in, brought me to life
          <br>Now I’m in paradise
          <br>
          <br>We should stay like this forever
          <br>How could anything be better?
          <br>
          <br>Kiss me with your eyes open
          <br>So you can see me when I'm melting
          <br>Kiss me with your eyes open
          <br>They dilate when you hold me close
          <br>Kiss me with your eyes open
          <br>
          <br>Kiss me with your eyes open
          <br>We should stay like this forever
          <br>Kiss me with your eyes open
          <br>We should stay like this forever
        </p>
