          [Intro: Bruno Mars]
          <br>Said baby, said baby, said baby
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars]
          <br>What you doin'? (What you doin'?)
          <br>Where you at? (Where you at?)
          <br>Oh, you got plans? (You got plans)
          <br>Don't say that (Shut your trap)
          <br>I'm sippin' wine (Sip, sip) in a robe (Drip, drip)
          <br>I look too good (Look too good)
          <br>To be alone (Woo, woo)
          <br>My house clean (House clean), my pool warm (Pool warm)
          <br>Just shaved, smooth like a newborn
          <br>We should be dancin', romancin'
          <br>In the east wing and the west wing
          <br>Of this mansion, what's happenin'?
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
          <br>I ain't playin' no games
          <br>Every word that I say is coming straight from my heart
          <br>So if you tryna lay in these arms
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
          <br>I'ma leave the door open
          <br>(I'ma leave the door open)
          <br>I'ma leave the door open, girl
          <br>(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
          <br>That you feel the way I feel
          <br>And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
          <br>Tell me that you're comin' through
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars]
          <br>Ooh, you're so sweet (So sweet), so tight (So tight)
          <br>I won't bite (Ah-ah), unless you like (Unless you like)
          <br>If you smoke (What you smoke?), I got the haze (Purple haze)
          <br>And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets (Woo)
          <br>Ooh, baby, don't keep me waitin'
          <br>There's so much love we could be making (Shamone!)
          <br>I'm talking kissing, cuddling
          <br>Rose petals in the bathtub
          <br>Girl, let's jump in, it's bubblin'
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
          <br>I ain't playin' no games
          <br>Every word that I say is coming straight from my heart
          <br>So if you're tryna lay in these arms (If you tryna lay in these arms)
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
          <br>I'ma leave the door open
          <br>(I'ma leave the door open)
          <br>I'ma leave the door open, girl
          <br>(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
          <br>That you feel the way I feel
          <br>And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
          <br>Tell me that you're comin' through (Come on, girl)
          <br>
          <br>[Bridge: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak]
          <br>La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I need you, baby)
          <br>La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I gotta see you, baby)
          <br>La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Girl, I'm tryna give you this, ah)
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
          <br>Hey, hey, I'ma leave my door open, baby
          <br>(I'ma leave the door open)
          <br>I'ma leave, I'ma leave my door open, girl
          <br>(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
          <br>And I'm hopin', hopin'
          <br>That you feel the way I feel
          <br>And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
          <br>Tell me that you're comin' through (Woo!)
          <br>
          <br>[Outro: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak]
          <br>La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Tell me)
          <br>Tell me that you're comin' through
          <br>(Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo)
          <br>(Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo-woo)
          <br>La-la-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la-la)
          <br>Tell me that you're comin' through
          <br>Girl, I'm here just waiting for you (Oh!)
          <br>Come on over, I'll adore you (I gotta know!)
          <br>La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I'm waiting, waiting, waiting)
          <br>Tell me that you're comin' through (For you)
          <br>Girl, I'm here just waiting for you
