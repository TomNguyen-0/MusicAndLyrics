        <p>
          You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
          <br>And with a word all my love came rushing out
          <br>And every whisper, it's the worst,
          <br>Emptied out by a single word
          <br>There is a hollow in me now
          <br>
          <br>So I put my faith in something unknown
          <br>I'm living on such sweet nothing
          <br>But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
          <br>I'm living on such sweet nothing
          <br>
          <br>And it's hard to learn
          <br>And it's hard to love
          <br>When you're giving me such sweet nothing
          <br>Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
          <br>You're giving me such sweet nothing
          <br>
          <br>[Beat break]
          <br>
          <br>It isn't easy for me to let it go
          <br>Cause I've swallowed every single word
          <br>And every whisper, every sigh
          <br>Eats away this heart of mine
          <br>And there is a hollow in me now
          <br>
          <br>So I put my faith in something unknown
          <br>I'm living on such sweet nothing
          <br>But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
          <br>I'm living on such sweet nothing
          <br>
          <br>And it's hard to learn
          <br>And it's hard to love
          <br>When you're giving me such sweet nothing
          <br>Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
          <br>You're giving me such sweet nothing
          <br>
          <br>[Beat break]
          <br>
          <br>And it's not enough to tell me that you care
          <br>When we both know the words are empty air
          <br>You give me nothing
          <br>
          <br>Uoooh
          <br>Uoooh
          <br>Uoooh
          <br>Nothing
          <br>
          <br>[Beat break]
          <br>
          <br>Uoooh
          <br>Uoooh
          <br>Uoooh
          <br>
          <br>Sweet nothing
          <br>
          <br>Uoooh
          <br>Uoooh
          <br>Uoooh
          <br>Sweet nothing
        </p>
