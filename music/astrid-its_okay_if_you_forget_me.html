        <p>
          Two weeks in, I'll wait till the feeling hits
          <br>Maybe I just haven't let it sink in
          <br>For three years we were living together
          <br>Held me like you'd hold me forever
          <br>Didn't think that heartbreak would feel like this
          <br>
          <br>From everything to nothing at all
          <br>From every day to never at all
          <br>And everyone says that I should be sad
          <br>Is it normal that
          <br>
          <br>I don't feel sorry for myself
          <br>Care if your hands touch somebody else
          <br>Wouldn't get jealous if you're happy
          <br>It's OK if you forget me
          <br>I don't feel empty now that you're gone
          <br>Does that mean it didn't mean nothing at all?
          <br>But I'll tell you what the worst is
          <br>It's the way it doesn't hurt when I wish it did
          <br>
          <br>Patience is a thing that I learned from you
          <br>That some things can't feel wrong even though they're true
          <br>Went through all the hard times together
          <br>Kept me calm when I'd lose my temper
          <br>I'm just really grateful that I had you
          <br>
          <br>From everything to nothing at all
          <br>Every day to never at all
          <br>And everyone says that I should be sad
          <br>Is it normal that
          <br>
          <br>I don't feel sorry for myself
          <br>Care if your hands touch somebody else
          <br>Wouldn't get jealous if you're happy
          <br>It's OK if you forget me
          <br>I don't feel empty now that you're gone
          <br>Does that mean it didn't mean nothing at all?
          <br>And I'll tell you what the worst is
          <br>It's the way it doesn't hurt when I wish it did
          <br>
          <br>I wish it did
          <br>When I wish it did
          <br>
          <br>From everything to nothing at all
          <br>From every day to never at all
          <br>And everyone says that I should be sad
          <br>Is it normal that
          <br>
          <br>I don't feel sorry for myself
          <br>Care if your hands touch somebody else
          <br>Wouldn't get jealous if you're happy
          <br>It's OK if you forget me

          <br>Does that mean it didn't mean nothing at all?
          <br>And I'll tell you what the worst is
          <br>It's the way it doesn't hurt when I wish it did
          <br>I wish it did
