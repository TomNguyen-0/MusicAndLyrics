        <p>
          [Verse 1]
          <br>Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
          <br>Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
          <br>Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
          <br>Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
          <br>Do you ever feel already buried deep?
          <br>Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
          <br>Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
          <br>'Cause there's a spark in you
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>You just gotta ignite the light
          <br>And let it shine
          <br>Just own the night
          <br>Like the Fourth of July
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>'Cause baby, you're a firework
          <br>Come on show 'em what you're worth
          <br>Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
          <br>As you shoot across the sky
          <br>Baby, you're a firework
          <br>Come on, let your colors burst
          <br>Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
          <br>You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>You don't have to feel like a waste of space
          <br>You're original, cannot be replaced
          <br>If you only knew what the future holds
          <br>After a hurricane comes a rainbow
          <br>Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
          <br>So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
          <br>Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
          <br>And when it's time, you'll know
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>You just gotta ignite the light
          <br>And let it shine
          <br>Just own the night
          <br>Like the Fourth of July
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>'Cause baby, you're a firework
          <br>Come on, show 'em what you're worth
          <br>Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
          <br>As you shoot across the sky
          <br>Baby, you're a firework
          <br>Come on, let your colors burst
          <br>Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
          <br>You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
          <br>
          <br>[Bridge]
          <br>Boom, boom, boom
          <br>Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
          <br>It's always been inside of you, you, you
          <br>And now it's time to let it through
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>'Cause baby, you're a firework
          <br>Come on, show 'em what you're worth
          <br>Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
          <br>As you shoot across the sky
          <br>Baby, you're a firework
          <br>Come on, let your colors burst
          <br>Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
          <br>You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
          <br>
          <br>[Outro]
          <br>Boom, boom, boom
          <br>Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
          <br>Boom, boom, boom
          <br>Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
        </p>
