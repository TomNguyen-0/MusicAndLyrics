        <p>
Think of me, think of me fondly
<br>When we've said goodbye
<br>Remember me, once in a while
<br>Please promise me you'll try
<br>When you find that once again you long
<br>To take your heart back and be free
<br>If you ever find a moment
<br>Spare a thought for me
<br>
<br>We never said our love was evergreen
<br>Or as unchanging as the sea
<br>But if you can still remember
<br>Stop and think of me
<br>Think of all the things
<br>We've shared and seen
<br>Don't think about the way
<br>Things might have been
<br>
<br>Think of me, think of me waking
<br>Silent and resigned
<br>Imagine me trying too hard
<br>To put you from my mind
<br>Recall those days
<br>Look back on all those times
<br>Think of the things we'll never do
<br>There will never be a day
<br>When I won't think of you
<br>
<br>Can it be, can it be Christine?
<br>Bravo!
<br>Long ago, it seems so long ago
<br>How young and innocent we were
<br>She may not remember me
<br>But I remember her
<br>
<br>Flowers fade, the fruits of summer fade
<br>They have their season so do we
<br>But please promise me that sometimes
<br>You will think of me
        </p>
