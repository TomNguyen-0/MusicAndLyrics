          <br>All those days watching from the windows
          <br>All those years outside looking in
          <br>All that time never even knowing
          <br>Just how blind I've been
          <br>Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
          <br>Now I'm here suddenly I see
          <br>Standing here it's oh so clear
          <br>I'm where I'm meant to be
          <br>
          <br>And at last I see the light
          <br>And it's like the fog has lifted
          <br>And at last I see the light
          <br>And it's like the sky is new
          <br>And it's warm and real and bright
          <br>And the world has somehow shifted
          <br>All at once everything looks different
          <br>Now that I see you</div>

          <br>All those days chasing down a daydream
          <br>All those years living in a blur
          <br>All that time never truly seeing
          <br>Things the way they were
          <br>Now she's here shining in the starlight
          <br>Now she's here suddenly I know
          <br>If she's here it's crystal clear
          <br>I'm where I'm meant to go</div>
