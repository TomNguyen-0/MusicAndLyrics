          Look at the stars
          <br>Look how they shine for you
          <br>And everything you do
          <br>Yeah, they were all yellow
          <br>I came along
          <br>I wrote a song for you
          <br>And all the things you do
          <br>And it was called "Yellow"
          <br>So then I took my turn
          <br>Oh, what a thing to have done
          <br>And it was all yellow
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus 1: Chris, Jonny & Will]
          <br>(Aah) Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
          <br>(Ooh) Turn into something beautiful
          <br>(Aah) You know, you know I love you so
          <br>You know I love you so
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
          <br>I swam across
          <br>I jumped across for you
          <br>Oh, what a thing to do
          <br>'Cause you were all yellow
          <br>I drew a line
          <br>I drew a line for you
          <br>Oh, what a thing to do
          <br>And it was all yellow
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus 2: Chris, Jonny & Will]
          <br>(Aah) Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
          <br>(Ooh) Turn into something beautiful
          <br>(Aah) And you know
          <br>For you, I'd bleed myself dry
          <br>For you, I'd bleed myself dry
          <br>
          <br>[Bridge: Chris Martin]
          <br>It's true, look how they shine for you
          <br>Look how they shine for you
          <br>Look how they shine for
          <br>Look how they shine for you
          <br>Look how they shine for you
          <br>Look how they shine
          <br>
          <br>[Outro: Chris Martin]
          <br>Look at the stars
          <br>Look how they shine for you
          <br>And all the things that you do
