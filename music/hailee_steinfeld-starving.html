          You know just what to say
          <br>Things that scare me
          <br>I should just walk away
          <br>But I can't move my feet
          <br>
          <br>The more that I know you, the more I want to
          <br>Something inside me's changed
          <br>I was so much younger yesterday, oh
          <br>
          <br>I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you
          <br>Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
          <br>By the way, right away you do things to my body
          <br>I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you
          <br>
          <br>I didn't know that I... I didn't know that I... 'til I tasted you
          <br>I didn't know that I... I didn't know that I... 'til I tasted you

          <br>
          <br>You know just how to make
          <br>My heart beat faster
          <br>Emotional earthquake
          <br>Bring on disaster
          <br>
          <br>You hit me head on, got me weak in my knees
          <br>Yeah, something inside me's changed
          <br>I was so much younger yesterday, aye
          <br>So much younger yesterday, oh, yeah
          <br>
          <br>I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you
          <br>Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
