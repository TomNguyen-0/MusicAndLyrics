          (Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
          <br>There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe
          <br>Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
          <br>There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe)
          <br>
          <br>Northern lights in our skies
          <br>Plants that grow and open your mind
          <br>Things that swim with a neon glow
          <br>How we all got here, nobody knows
          <br>
          <br>These are real things
          <br>These are real things
          <br>
          <br>Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
          <br>All kinds of magic all around us, it's hard to believe
          <br>Thank God it's not too good to be true
          <br>Oh, what a world, and then there is you
          <br>
          <br>Did I know you once in another life?
          <br>Are we here just once or a billion times?
          <br>Well, I wish I knew, but it doesn't matter
          <br>'Cause you're here right now, and I know what I feel
          <br>
          <br>And these are real things
          <br>Yeah, these are real things
          <br>
          <br>Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
          <br>All kinds of magic all around us, it's hard to believe
          <br>Thank God it's not too good to be true
          <br>Oh, what a world, and then there is you
          <br>Oh, and then there is you
          <br>
          <br>These are real things
          <br>These are real things
          <br>
          <br>Oh, what a world, all kinds of magic
          <br>Tell me it's not too good to be true
          <br>Oh, what a world, and then there is you
          <br>
          <br>(Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
          <br>There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe)
          <br>And then there is you
          <br>(Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
          <br>There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe)
          <br>And then there is you
