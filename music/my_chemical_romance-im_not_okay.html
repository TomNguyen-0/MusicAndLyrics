          Well if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say.
          <br>I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way.
          <br>For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend took,
          <br>Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?
          <br>
          <br>I'm not okay
          <br>I'm not okay
          <br>I'm not okay
          <br>You wear me out
          <br>
          <br>What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems?
          <br>(I'm not okay)
          <br>I've told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
          <br>(I'm not okay)
          <br>To be a joke and look, another line without a hook
          <br>I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!
          <br>
          <br>I'm not okay
          <br>I'm not okay
          <br>I'm not okay
          <br>You wear me out
          <br>
          <br>Forget about the dirty looks
          <br>The photographs your boyfriend took
          <br>You said you read me like a book, but the pages all are torn and frayed
          <br>
          <br>I'm okay
          <br>I'm okay!
          <br>I'm okay, now
          <br>(I'm okay, now)
          <br>
          <br>But you really need to listen to me
          <br>Because I'm telling you the truth
          <br>I mean this, I'm okay!
          <br>(Trust Me)
          <br>
          <br>I'm not okay
          <br>I'm not okay
          <br>Well, I'm not okay
          <br>[Album version:] I'm not o-fucking-kay
          <br>[Music video:] I'm really not okay
          <br>I'm not okay
          <br>I'm not okay
          <br>(Okay)
        </p>
