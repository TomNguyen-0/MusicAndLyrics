        <p>
            I remember the rise
            <br>We were running backyard to yard
            <br>Wasn't scared of going too far, staying out til it's too dark
            <br>
            <br>Now daylight don't make it right
            <br>And you would really know this
            <br>Closed hearts make closed minds
            <br>I won't tell you it's all butterflies and roses
            <br>When I back in time
            <br>
            <br>When we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
            <br>Back then when we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
            <br>There's not much comfort in this place
            <br>Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha I'll keep you safe
            <br>When you can't fight the bitter taste
            <br>Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha I'll keep you safe
            <br>
            <br>I don't remember it all
            <br>But I know that I was invincible
            <br>Like the heroes in the cartoons
            <br>Saving lives through my living room
            <br>
            <br>Now daylight don't make it right
            <br>And you would really know this
            <br>Closed hearts make closed minds
            <br>I won't tell you it's all butterflies and roses
            <br>When I back in time
            <br>
            <br>When we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
            <br>Back then when we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
            <br>There's not much comfort in this place
            <br>Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha I'll keep you safe
            <br>When you can't fight the bitter taste
            <br>Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha I'll keep you safe
            <br>I know that I'm a fighter
            <br>Yeah, always been a fighter
            <br>But I tried to play with fire and I got burned
            <br>Don't know how to help us
            <br>Yeah, I'm feeling kind of helpless
            <br>Yeah, maybe you so selfish if it don't wanna hurt
            <br>I know that I'm a fighter
            <br>Yeah, always been a fighter
            <br>But I tried to play with fire and I got burned
