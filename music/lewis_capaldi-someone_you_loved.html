          I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
          <br>This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
          <br>
          <br>I need somebody to heal
          <br>Somebody to know
          <br>Somebody to have
          <br>Somebody to hold
          <br>It's easy to say
          <br>But it's never the same
          <br>I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
          <br>
          <br>Now the day bleeds
          <br>Into nightfall
          <br>And you're not here
          <br>To get me through it all
          <br>I let my guard down
          <br>And then you pulled the rug
          <br>I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
          <br>
          <br>I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
          <br>This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
          <br>
          <br>Now, I need somebody to know
          <br>Somebody to heal
          <br>Somebody to have
          <br>Just to know how it feels
          <br>It's easy to say
          <br>But it's never the same
          <br>I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
          <br>
          <br>Now the day bleeds
          <br>Into nightfall
          <br>And you're not here
          <br>To get me through it all
          <br>I let my guard down
          <br>And then you pulled the rug
          <br>I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
          <br>
          <br>And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
          <br>I fall into your arms
          <br>I'll be safe in your sound til I come back around
          <br>
          <br>For now the day bleeds
          <br>Into nightfall
          <br>And you're not here
          <br>To get me through it all
          <br>I let my guard down
          <br>And then you pulled the rug
          <br>I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
          <br>
          <br>But now the day bleeds
          <br>Into nightfall
          <br>And you're not here
          <br>To get me through it all
          <br>I let my guard down
          <br>And then you pulled the rug
          <br>I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
          <br>
          <br>I let my guard down
          <br>And then you pulled the rug
          <br>I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
