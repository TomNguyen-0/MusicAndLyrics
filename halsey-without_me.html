        <p>
            Found you when your heart was broke
            <br>I filled your cup until it overflowed
            <br>Took it so far to keep you close (keep you close)
            <br>I was afraid to leave you on your own
            <br>
            <br>I said I'd catch you if you fall
            <br>And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
            <br>And then I got you off your knees
            <br>Put you right back on your feet
            <br>Just so you could take advantage of me
            <br>
            <br>Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there
            <br>Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
            <br>You know I'm the one who put you up there
            <br>Name in the sky
            <br>Does it ever get lonely?
            <br>Thinking you could live without me
            <br>Thinking you could live without me
            <br>Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
            <br>I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
            <br>Thinking you could live without me
            <br>Live without me
            <br>Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
            <br>I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah yeah)
            <br>
            <br>Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (hundred tries)
            <br>Just running from the demons in your mind
            <br>Then I took yours and made 'em mine (made 'em mine)
            <br>I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind
            <br>
            <br>Said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
            <br>And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
            <br>And then I got you off your knees
            <br>Put you right back on your feet
            <br>Just so you can take advantage of me

            <br>I don't know why, yeah
            <br>
            <br>You don't have to say just what you did
            <br>I already know (I know)
            <br>I had to go and find out from them
            <br>So tell me how's it feel (oh-woah)
            <br>
            <br>Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there
