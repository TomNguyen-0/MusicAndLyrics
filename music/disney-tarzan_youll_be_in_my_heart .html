        <p>
          Come stop your crying
          <br>It will be alright
          <br>Just take my hand
          <br>Hold it tight
          <br>
          <br>I will protect you
          <br>From all around you
          <br>I will be here
          <br>Don't you cry
          <br>
          <br>For one so small,
          <br>You seem so strong
          <br>My arms will hold you,
          <br>Keep you safe and warm
          <br>
          <br>This bond between us
          <br>Can't be broken
          <br>I will be here
          <br>Don't you cry
          <br>
          <br>'Cause you'll be in my heart
          <br>Yes, you'll be in my heart
          <br>From this day on
          <br>Now and forever more
          <br>
          <br>You'll be in my heart
          <br>No matter what they say
          <br>You'll be here in my heart always
          <br>
          <br>Why can't they understand the way we feel?
          <br>They just don't trust what they can't explain
          <br>I know we're different but deep inside us
          <br>We're not that different at all
          <br>
          <br>And you'll be in my heart
          <br>Yes, you'll be in my heart
          <br>From this day on
          <br>Now and forever more
          <br>
          <br>Don't listen to them
          <br>'Cause what do they know (what do they know)?
          <br>We need each other
          <br>To have, to hold.
          <br>They'll see in time
          <br>I know
          <br>
          <br>When destiny calls you
          <br>You must be strong (you gotta be strong)
          <br>I may not be with you
          <br>But you've got to hold on
          <br>They'll see in time
          <br>I know
          <br>We'll show them together
          <br>
          <br>'Cause you'll be in my heart
          <br>Believe me, you'll be in my heart
          <br>I'll be there from this day on,
          <br>Now and forever more
          <br>
          <br>Oh, you'll be in my heart (you'll be here in my heart)
          <br>No matter what they say (I'll be with you)
          <br>You'll be here in my heart (I'll be there) always
          <br>
          <br>Always
          <br>I'll be with you
          <br>I'll be there for you always
          <br>Always and always
          <br>Just look over your shoulder
          <br>Just look over your shoulder
          <br>Just look over your shoulder
          <br>I'll be there always.
        </p>
