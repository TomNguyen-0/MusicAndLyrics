        <p>
          Now I will tell you what I've done for you
          <br>Fifty thousand tears I've cried
          <br>Screaming, deceiving and bleeding for you
          <br>And you still won't hear me going under
          <br>Don't want your hand this time - I'll save myself
          <br>Maybe I'll wake up for once (wake up for once)
          <br>Not tormented daily defeated by you
          <br>Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom
          <br>
          <br>I'm dying again
          <br>
          <br>I'm going under (going under)
          <br>Drowning in you (drowning in you)
          <br>I'm falling forever (falling forever)
          <br>I've got to break through
          <br>I'm going under
          <br>
          <br>Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies (so I don't know what's real)
          <br>So I don't know what's real and what's not (don't know what's real and what's not)
          <br>Always confusing the thoughts in my head
          <br>So I can't trust myself anymore
          <br>
          <br>I'm dying again
          <br>
          <br>I'm going under (going under)
          <br>Drowning in you (drowning in you)
          <br>I'm falling forever (falling forever)
          <br>I've got to break through
          <br>I'm...
          <br>
          <br>So go on and scream, scream at me
          <br>I'm so far away (so far away)
          <br>I won't be broken again (again)
          <br>I've got to breathe
          <br>I can't keep going under
          <br>
          <br>I'm dying again
          <br>
          <br>I'm going under (going under)
          <br>Drowning in you (drowning in you)
          <br>I'm falling forever (falling forever)
          <br>I've got to break through
          <br>I'm going under (going under)
          <br>Going under (drowning in you)
          <br>I'm going under
        </p>
