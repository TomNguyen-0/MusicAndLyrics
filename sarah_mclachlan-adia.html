Adia, I do believe I failed you
<br>Adia, I know I've let you down
<br>Don't you know I tried so hard
<br>To love you in my way
<br>It's easy, let it go
<br>
<br>Adia, I'm empty since you left me
<br>Trying to find a way to carry on
<br>I search myself and everyone
<br>To see where we went wrong
<br>
<br>There's no one left to finger
<br>There's no one here to blame
<br>There's no one left to talk to, honey
<br>And there ain't no one to buy our innocence
<br>'Cause we are born innocent
<br>Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
<br>It's easy, we all falter
<br>Does it matter?
<br>
<br>Adia, I thought that we could make it
<br>I know I can't change the way you feel
<br>I leave you with your misery
<br>A friend who won't betray
<br>I pull you from your tower
<br>I take away your pain
<br>And show you all the beauty you possess
<br>If you'd only let yourself believe
<br>
<br>That we are born innocent
<br>Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
<br>It's easy, we all falter
<br>Does it matter?
<br>
<br>'Cause we are born innocent
<br>Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
<br>It's easy, we all falter
<br>Does it matter?
<br>
<br>Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
<br>'Cause we are born innocent
<br>Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
<br>It's easy, we all falter
<br>Does it matter?
