          You know it ain't easy
          <br>For these thoughts here to leave me
          <br>There's no words to describe it
          <br>In French or in English
          <br>'Cause, diamonds they fade
          <br>And flowers they bloom
          <br>And I'm telling you
          <br>
          <br>These feelings won't go away
          <br>They've been knockin' me sideways
          <br>They've been knockin' me out, babe
          <br>Whenever you come around me
          <br>These feelings won't go away
          <br>They've been knockin' me sideways
          <br>I keep thinking in a moment that
          <br>Time will take them away
          <br>But these feelings won't go away
          <br>
          <br>But these feelings won't go away
          <br>
          <br>It ain't easy
          <br>For these thoughts here to leave me
          <br>There're no words to describe it
          <br>In French or in English
          <br>'Cause diamonds they fade (diamonds they fade)
          <br>And flowers they bloom (flowers they bloom)
          <br>And I'm telling you
          <br>
          <br>These feelings won't go away
          <br>They've been knockin' me sideways
          <br>They've been knockin' me out, babe
          <br>Whenever you come around me
          <br>These feelings won't go away
          <br>They've been knockin' me sideways

          <br>These feelings won't go away
