          And another one bites the dust
          <br>Oh why can I not conquer love?
          <br>And I might have thought that we were one
          <br>Wanted to fight this war without weapons
          <br>
          <br>And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
          <br>But there were so many red flags
          <br>Now another one bites the dust
          <br>Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one
          <br>
          <br>You did not break me
          <br>I'm still fighting for peace
          <br>
          <br>Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
          <br>But your blade—it might be too sharp
          <br>I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
          <br>Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
          <br>But you won't see me fall apart
          <br>'Cause I've got an elastic heart
          <br>
          <br>I've got an elastic heart
          <br>Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
          <br>
          <br>And I will stay up through the night
          <br>And let's be clear, won't close my eyes
          <br>And I know that I can survive
          <br>I'll walk through fire to save my life
          <br>
          <br>And I want it, I want my life so bad
          <br>I'm doing everything I can
          <br>Then another one bites the dust
          <br>It's hard to lose a chosen one
          <br>
          <br>You did not break me
          <br>(You did not break me, no)
          <br>I'm still fighting for peace
          <br>
          <br>Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
          <br>But your blade—it might be too sharp

          <br>Yeah, I may snap and I move fast

          <br>'Cause I've got an elastic heart
          <br>
          <br>Oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh
          <br>Oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
          <br>Oh-oh-oh-oh
          <br>
