        <p>
            
<br>I have often dreamed of a far off place
<br>Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
<br>Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
<br>And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be
<br>
<br>I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
<br>I will find my way if I can be strong
<br>I know every mile would be worth my while
<br>When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong
<br>
<br>Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
<br>Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
<br>And a thousand years would be worth the wait
<br>It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through
<br>
<br>And I won't look back, I can go the distance
<br>And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
<br>It's an uphill slope
<br>But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
<br>And my journey is complete, oh yeah
<br>
<br>But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
<br>For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh
<br>
<br>Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
<br>I will search the world, I will face its harms
<br>I don't care how far, I can go the distance
<br>'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms
<br>
<br>I will search the world, I will face its harms
<br>'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms
        </p>
