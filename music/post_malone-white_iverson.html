          <br>Like I'm Davis from New Orleans
          <br>Or bitch I'm Harden, I don't miss nothin'
          <br>Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it (Ayy)
          <br>I have it, I never pass it, I work my magic
          <br>High average, ball on these bastards, it makes me happy
          <br>It's tragic, I make it happen, and all y'all Shaqtin'
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>White Iverson
