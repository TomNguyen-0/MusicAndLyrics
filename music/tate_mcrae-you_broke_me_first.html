          [Intro]
          <br>You broke me first
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 1]
          <br>Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
          <br>But you should'a told me
          <br>That you were thinking 'bout someone else
          <br>You're drunk at a party
          <br>Or maybe it's just that your car broke down
          <br>Your phone's been off for a couple of months
          <br>So you're calling me now
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>I know you, you're like this
          <br>When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
          <br>And like me, I did
          <br>But I ran out of every reason
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>Now suddenly you're asking for it back
          <br>Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
          <br>Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
          <br>But I don't really care how bad it hurts
          <br>When you broke me first
          <br>You broke me first
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
          <br>That you moved on quicker than I could've ever
          <br>You know that hurt
          <br>Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone
          <br>Just to see your name
          <br>But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>I know you, you're like this
          <br>When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
          <br>And like me, I did
          <br>But I ran out of every reason
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>Now suddenly you're asking for it back
          <br>Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
          <br>Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
          <br>But I don't really care how bad it hurts
          <br>When you broke me first
          <br>You broke me first
          <br>
          <br>[Bridge]
          <br>What did you think would happen?
          <br>What did you think would happen?
          <br>I'll never let you have it
          <br>What did you think would happen?
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>Now suddenly you're asking for it back
          <br>Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
          <br>Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
          <br>But I don't really care how bad it hurts
          <br>When you broke me first
          <br>You broke me first (You broke me first)
          <br>You broke me first, ooh oh
        </p>
