        <p>
            Heaven bend to take my hand
            <br>And lead me through the fire
            <br>Be the long awaited answer
            <br>To a long and painful fight
            <br>
            <br>Truth be told I've tried my best
            <br>But somewhere along the way
            <br>I got caught up in all there was to offer
            <br>And the cost was so much more than I could bear
            <br>
            <br>Though I've tried, I've fallen...
            <br>I have sunk so low
            <br>I messed up
            <br>Better I should know
            <br>So don't come round here
            <br>And tell me I told you so...
            <br>
            <br>We all begin with good intent
            <br>Love was raw and young
            <br>We believed that we could change ourselves
            <br>The past could be undone
            <br>But we carry on our backs the burden
            <br>Time always reveals
            <br>In the lonely light of morning
            <br>In the wound that would not heal
            <br>It's the bitter taste of losing everything
            <br>That I've held so dear.
            <br>
            <br>I've fallen...
            <br>I have sunk so low
            <br>I messed up
            <br>Better I should know
            <br>So don't come round here
            <br>And tell me I told you so...
            <br>
            <br>Heaven bend to take my hand
            <br>Nowhere left to turn
            <br>I'm lost to those I thought were friends
            <br>To everyone I know
            <br>Oh they turn their heads embarassed
            <br>Pretend that they don't see
            <br>But it's one missed step
            <br>One slip before you know it
            <br>And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed
            <br>
            <br>Though I've tried, I've fallen...
            <br>I have sunk so low
            <br>I messed up
            <br>Better I should know
            <br>So don't come round here
            <br>And tell me I told you so...
            <br>
            <br>Though I've tried, I've fallen...
            <br>I have sunk so low
            <br>I messed up
            <br>Better I should know
            <br>So don't come round here
            <br>And tell me I told you so...
