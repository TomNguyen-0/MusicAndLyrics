        <p>
          I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
          <br>Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
          <br>Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
          <br>Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know
          <br>
          <br>Ooh oh
          <br>
          <br>You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
          <br>You say I am strong when I think I am weak
          <br>And You say I am held when I am falling short
          <br>And when I don't belong, oh You say I am Yours
          <br>And I believe, (I) oh I believe (I)
          <br>What You say of me (I)
          <br>I believe
          <br>
          <br>The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
          <br>In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity
          <br>
          <br>Ooh oh
          <br>
          <br>You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
          <br>You say I am strong when I think I am weak
          <br>And You say I am held when I am falling short
          <br>When I don't belong, oh You say I am Yours
          <br>And I believe, (I) oh I believe (I)
          <br>What You say of me (I)
          <br>Oh, I believe
          <br>
          <br>Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at your feet
          <br>You have every failure God, You have every victory
          <br>
          <br>Ooh oh
          <br>
          <br>You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
          <br>You say I am strong when I think I am weak
          <br>You say I am held when I am falling short
          <br>When I don't belong, oh You say I am Yours
          <br>And I believe, (I) oh I believe (I)
          <br>What You say of me (I)
          <br>I believe
          <br>
          <br>Oh I believe, oh
          <br>Yes I believe, oh
          <br>What You say of me
          <br>Oh I believe
