        <p>
          I'm tired of being what you want me to be
          <br>Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
          <br>Don't know what you're expecting of me
          <br>Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
          <br>
          <br>Every step that I take is another mistake to you
          <br>(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
          <br>
          <br>I've become so numb
          <br>I can't feel you there
          <br>Become so tired
          <br>So much more aware
          <br>
          <br>I'm becoming this
          <br>All I want to do
          <br>Is be more like me
          <br>And be less like you
          <br>
          <br>Can't you see that you're smothering me
          <br>Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
          <br>'Cause everything that you thought I would be
          <br>Has fallen apart right in front of you
          <br>
          <br>Every step that I take is another mistake to you
          <br>(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
          <br>And every second I waste is more than I can take
          <br>
          <br>I've become so numb
          <br>I can't feel you there
          <br>Become so tired
          <br>So much more aware
          <br>
          <br>I'm becoming this
          <br>All I want to do
          <br>Is be more like me
          <br>And be less like you
          <br>
          <br>And I know
          <br>I may end up failing too
          <br>But I know
          <br>You were just like me with someone disappointed in you
          <br>
          <br>I've become so numb
          <br>I can't feel you there
          <br>Become so tired
          <br>So much more aware
          <br>
          <br>I'm becoming this
          <br>All I want to do
          <br>Is be more like me
          <br>And be less like you
          <br>
          <br>I've become so numb
          <br>I can't feel you there
          <br>(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
          <br>I've become so numb
          <br>I can't feel you there
          <br>(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
