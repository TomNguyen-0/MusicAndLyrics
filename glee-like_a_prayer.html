Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
<br>I hear you call my name and it feels like home...
<br>
<br>When you call my name it's like a little prayer
<br>I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
<br>In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
<br>Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you 
<br>
<br>I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
<br>I have no choice, I hear your voice
<br>Feels like flying
<br>I close my eyes, oh God, I think I'm falling
<br>Out of the sky, I close my eyes
<br>Heaven help me
<br>
<br>When you call my name it's like a little prayer
<br>I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
<br>In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
<br>Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there
<br>
<br>I'm like a child, you whisper softly to me
<br>You're in control, just like a child
<br>Now I'm dancing
<br>It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
<br>You're here with me, it's like a dream
<br>Let the choir sing
<br>
<br>When you call my name, it's like a little prayer
<br>I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
<br>In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
<br>Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there
<br>When you call my name it's like a little prayer
<br>I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
<br>In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
<br>Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there
<br>
<br>Oh, oh
<br>Oh, oh
<br>
<br>Life is a mystery (Oh, oh)
<br>Everyone must stand alone (Oh, oh)
<br>I hear you call my name (Ohhh...)
<br>And it feels like home
<br>
<br>Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there (Oh, oh)
<br>Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery (Oh, oh)
<br>Just like a dream, you are not what you seem (Ohhh...)
<br>Just like a prayer, no choice, your voice can take me there
<br>
<br>Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
<br>It's like a dream to me (Ohhh)
<br>Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
<br>It's like a dream to me (Just like a dream to me)
<br>Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Oh, whoa)
<br>It's like a dream to me (Like a dream, like a dream)
<br>Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
<br>It's like a dream to me (Ohhh)
<br>
<br>Life is a mystery (Just like a prayer)
<br>Everyone must stand alone (Your voice can take me there)
<br>I hear you call my name (You call my name)
<br>And it feels like home
<br>
<br>Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there (Just like a prayer)
<br>Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery (Your voice can take me there)
<br>Just like a dream, you are not what you seem (Just like a dream)
<br>Just like a prayer, no choice, your voice can take me there
<br>
<br>Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
<br>Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
<br>Just like a prayer, no choice, your voice can take me there
