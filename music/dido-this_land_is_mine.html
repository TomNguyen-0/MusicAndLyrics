        <p>
          From behind these walls I hear your song, oh sweet words
          <br>The music that you play lights up my world
          <br>The sweetest that I've heard
          <br>Could it be that I've been touched and turned? Oh Lord, please
          <br>Finally, finally things are changing
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus:]
          <br>This land is mine but I'll let you rule
          <br>I'll let you navigate and demand
          <br>Just as long as you know, this land is mine
          <br>So find your home and settle in
          <br>Oh, I'm ready to let you in
          <br>Just as long as we know, this land is mine
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2:]
          <br>After all the battles and the wars, the scars and loss
          <br>Well, I'm still the queen of my domain
          <br>And feeling stronger now
          <br>The walls are down a little more each day, since you came
          <br>Finally, finally things are changing
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>
          <br>[Bridge:]
          <br>Follow the days I've traveled alone
          <br>In this cold and colorless place till now
          <br>It's what I had to pay
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>
          <br>[Outro:]
          <br>This land is mine but I'll let you rule
          <br>I'll let you navigate and demand
          <br>Just as long as you know, this land is mine
        </p>
