        <p>
          I tried to swim against
          <br>Have brought me down upon my knees
          <br>Oh I beg, I beg and plead
          <br>Singin', come out of things unsaid
          <br>Shoot an apple off my head
          <br>And a trouble that can't be named
          <br>A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>You are
          <br>You are
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>Confusion never stops
          <br>Closing walls and tickin' clocks
          <br>Gonna come back and take you home
          <br>I could not stop that you now know
          <br>Singin', come out upon my seas
          <br>Cursed missed opportunities
          <br>Am I a part of the cure?
          <br>Or am I part of the disease? Singin'
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>You are
          <br>You are
          <br>You are
          <br>You are
          <br>You are
          <br>You are
          <br>[Bridge]
          <br>And nothing else compares
          <br>Oh, nothing else compares
          <br>And nothing else compares
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>You are
          <br>You are
          <br>
          <br>[Outro]
          <br>Home
          <br>Home, where I wanted to go
          <br>Home
          <br>Home, where I wanted to go
          <br>Home (You are)
          <br>Home, where I wanted to go
          <br>Home (You are)
          <br>Home, where I wanted to go
        </p>
