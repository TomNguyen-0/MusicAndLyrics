Party girls don't get hurt
<br>Can't feel anything, when will I learn?
<br>I push it down, push it down
<br>I'm the one "for a good time call"
<br>Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
<br>I feel the love, feel the love
<br>
<br>One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
<br>One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
<br>One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
<br>Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
<br>
<br>I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
<br>From the chandelier
<br>I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
<br>Like it doesn't exist
<br>I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
<br>Feel my tears as they dry
<br>I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
<br>From the chandelier
<br>
<br>But I'm holding on for dear life
<br>Won't look down, won't open my eyes
<br>Keep my glass full until morning light
<br>'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
<br>Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
<br>Won't look down, won't open my eyes
<br>Keep my glass full until morning light
<br>'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight, on for tonight
<br>
<br>Sun is up, I'm a mess
<br>Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
<br>Here comes the shame, here comes the shame
<br>
<br>One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
<br>One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
<br>One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
<br>Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
<br>
<br>I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
<br>From the chandelier
<br>I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
<br>Like it doesn't exist
<br>I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
<br>Feel my tears as they dry
<br>I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
<br>From the chandelier
<br>
<br>But I'm holding on for dear life
<br>Won't look down, won't open my eyes
<br>Keep my glass full until morning light
<br>'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
<br>Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
<br>Won't look down, won't open my eyes
<br>Keep my glass full until morning light
<br>'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
<br>On for tonight, on for tonight
<br>
<br>'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
<br>Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
<br>On for tonight, on for tonight
<br>'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
<br>'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
<br>Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
<br>On for tonight, on for tonight
