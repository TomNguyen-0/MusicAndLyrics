            It starts with one
            <br>All I know
            <br>It's so unreal
            <br>Watch you go
            <br>
            <br>I tried so hard and got so far
            <br>But in the end, it doesn't even matter
            <br>I had to fall to lose it all
            <br>But in the end, it doesn't even matter
            <br>
            <br>One thing, I don't know why
            <br>It doesn't even matter how hard you try
            <br>Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
            <br>To remind myself of a time when I tried so hard
            <br>In spite of the way you were mockin' me
            <br>Actin' like I was part of your property
            <br>Remembering all the times you fought with me
            <br>I'm surprised it got so far
            <br>Things aren't the way they were before
            <br>You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
            <br>Not that you knew me back then
            <br>But it all comes back to me in the end
            <br>You kept everything inside
            <br>And even though I tried, it all fell apart
            <br>What it meant to me will eventually
            <br>Be a memory of a time when I
            <br>
            <br>I tried so hard and got so far
            <br>But in the end, it doesn't even matter
            <br>I had to fall to lose it all
            <br>But in the end, it doesn't even matter
            <br>
            <br>One thing, I don't know why
            <br>It doesn't even matter how hard you try
            <br>Keep that in mind
            <br>I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
            <br>All I know
            <br>Time is a valuable thing
            <br>Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
            <br>Watch it count down to the end of the day
            <br>The clock ticks life away
            <br>It's so unreal
            <br>You didn't look out below
            <br>Watch the time go right out the window
            <br>Tryin' to hold on, they didn't even know
            <br>I wasted it all just to watch you go
            <br>I kept everything inside
            <br>And even though I tried, it all fell apart
            <br>What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
            <br>Of a time when I tried so hard
        </p>
