        <p>
          7 AM, the usual morning lineup:
          <br>Start on the chores and sweep 'til the floor's all clean,
          <br>Polish and wax, do laundry, and mop and shine up
          <br>Sweep again,
          <br>And by then
          <br>It's like 7:15.
          <br>
          <br>And so I'll read a book or maybe two or three
          <br>I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery
          <br>I'll play guitar and knit, and cook and basically
          <br>Just wonder when will my life begin?
          <br>
          <br>Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts, and baking
          <br>Paper mache, a bit of ballet and chess
          <br>Pottery and ventriloquy, candle making
          <br>Then I'll stretch,
          <br>Maybe sketch,
          <br>Take a climb, sew a dress!
          <br>
          <br>And I'll reread the books if I have time to spare
          <br>I'll paint the walls some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere.
          <br>And then I'll brush and brush, and brush and brush my hair
          <br>Stuck in the same place I've always been.
          <br>
          <br>And I'll keep wonderin' and wonderin', and wonderin', and wonderin'
          <br>When will my life begin?
          <br>
          <br>Tomorrow night the lights will appear
          <br>Just like they do on my birthday each year.
          <br>What is it like out there where they glow?
          <br>Now that I'm older, mother might just let me go.
        </p>
