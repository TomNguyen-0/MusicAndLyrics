        <p>
          Two weeks away feels like the whole world should've changed
          <br>But I'm home now
          <br>And things still look the same
          <br>I think I'll leave it till tomorrow to unpack
          <br>Try to forget for one more night
          <br>That I'm back in my flat on the road
          <br>Where the cars never stop going through the night
          <br>To a life where I can't watch the sun set
          <br>I don't have time
          <br>I don't have time
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus:]
          <br>I've still got sand in my shoes
          <br>And I can't shake the thought of you
          <br>I should get on, forget you
          <br>But why would I want to
          <br>I know we said goodbye
          <br>Anything else would've been confused
          <br>But I wanna see you again
          <br>
          <br>Tomorrow's back to work and down to sanity
          <br>Should run a bath and then clear up the mess I made before I left here
          <br>Try to remind myself that I was happy here
          <br>Before I knew that I could get on the plane and fly away
          <br>From the road where the cars never stop going through the night
          <br>To a life where I can watch the sun set
          <br>And take my time
          <br>Take all our time
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>
          <br>I wanna see you again
          <br>I wanna see you again
          <br>
          <br>Two weeks away, all it takes to change and turn me around, I've fallen
          <br>I walked away and never said that I wanted to see you again
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus x2]
          <br>
          <br>I wanna see you again
          <br>I wanna see you again
        </p>
