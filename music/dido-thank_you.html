        <p>
          [Verse 1]
          <br>My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why
          <br>I got out of bed at all
          <br>The morning rain clouds up my window
          <br>And I can't see at all
          <br>And even if I could, it'd all be grey
          <br>But your picture on my wall
          <br>It reminds me that it's not so bad
          <br>It's not so bad
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
          <br>My head just feels in pain
          <br>I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
          <br>I'm late for work again
          <br>And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
          <br>That I might not last the day
          <br>And then you call me
          <br>And it's not so bad, it's not so bad
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>And I want to thank you
          <br>For giving me the best day of my life
          <br>Oh, just to be with you
          <br>Is having the best day of my life
          <br>[Verse 3]
          <br>Push the door, I'm home at last
          <br>And I'm soaking through and through
          <br>Then you handed me a towel
          <br>And all I see is you
          <br>And even if my house falls down now
          <br>I wouldn't have a clue
          <br>Because you're near me
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>And I want to thank you
          <br>For giving me the best day of my life
          <br>Oh, just to be with you
          <br>Is having the best day of my life
          <br>And I want to thank you
          <br>For giving me the best day of my life
          <br>Oh, just to be with you
          <br>Is having the best day of my life
        </p>
