        <p>
          You were the shadow to my light
          <br>Did you feel us?
          <br>Another star
          <br>You fade away
          <br>Afraid our aim is out of sight
          <br>Wanna see us
          <br>Alight
          <br>
          <br>Where are you now?
          <br>Where are you now?
          <br>Where are you now?
          <br>Was it all in my fantasy?
          <br>Where are you now?
          <br>Were you only imaginary?
          <br>
          <br>Where are you now?
          <br>Atlantis
          <br>Under the sea
          <br>Under the sea
          <br>Where are you now?
          <br>Another dream
          <br>The monster's running wild inside of me
          <br>I'm faded
          <br>I'm faded
          <br>So lost, I'm faded
          <br>I'm faded
          <br>So lost, I'm faded
          <br>
          <br>These shallow waters never met what I needed
          <br>I'm letting go a deeper dive
          <br>Eternal silence of the sea, I'm breathing
          <br>Alive
          <br>
          <br>Where are you now?
          <br>Where are you now?
          <br>Under the bright but faded lights
          <br>You've set my heart on fire
          <br>Where are you now?
          <br>Where are you now?
          <br>
          <br>Where are you now?
          <br>Atlantis
          <br>Under the sea
          <br>Under the sea
          <br>Where are you now?
          <br>Another dream
          <br>The monster's running wild inside of me
          <br>I'm faded
          <br>I'm faded
          <br>So lost, I'm faded
          <br>I'm faded
          <br>So lost, I'm faded
        </p>
