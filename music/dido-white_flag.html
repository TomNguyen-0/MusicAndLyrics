        <p>
          [Verse 1]
          <br>I know you think that
          <br>I shouldn't still love you
          <br>Or tell you that
          <br>But if I didn't say it
          <br>Well, I'd still have felt it
          <br>Where's the sense in that?
          <br>I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
          <br>Or return to where we were
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>But I will go down with this ship
          <br>And I won't put my hands up and surrender
          <br>There will be no white flag above my door
          <br>I'm in love and always will be
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>I know I left too
          <br>Much mess and destruction
          <br>To come back again
          <br>And I caused nothing but trouble
          <br>I understand if you
          <br>Can't talk to me again
          <br>And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
          <br>Then I'm sure that that makes sense
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>But I will go down with this ship
          <br>And I won't put my hands up and surrender
          <br>There will be no white flag above my door
          <br>I'm in love and always will be
          <br>
          <br>And when we meet
          <br>which im sure we will
          <br>all that was then
          <br>will be there still
          <br>ill let it pass
          <br>and hold my tongue
          <br>and you will think
          <br>that ive moved on
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>But I will go down with this ship
          <br>And I won't put my hands up and surrender
          <br>There will be no white flag above my door
          <br>I'm in love and always will be
        </p>
