          If God had a name, what would it be?
          <br>And would you call it to his face
          <br>If you were faced with Him in all His glory?
          <br>What would you ask if you had just one question?
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>And yeah, yeah, God is great
          <br>Yeah, yeah, God is good
          <br>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>What if God was one of us
          <br>Just a slob like one of us
          <br>Just a stranger on the bus, tryna make his way home?
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>If God had a face, what would it look like?
          <br>And would you want to see
          <br>If seeing meant that you would have to believe
          <br>In things like heaven and in Jesus and the saints
          <br>And all the prophets?
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>And yeah, yeah, God is great
          <br>Yeah, yeah, God is good
          <br>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>What if God was one of us
          <br>Just a slob like one of us
          <br>Just a stranger on the bus, tryna make his way home?
          <br>
          <br>[Bridge]
          <br>Just tryna make his way home
          <br>Back up to heaven all alone
          <br>Nobody calling on the phone
          <br>'Cept for the Pope, maybe in Rome
          <br>
          <br>[Break]
          <br>Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>Yeah, yeah, God is great
          <br>Yeah, yeah, God is good
          <br>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>What if God was one of us
          <br>Just a slob like one of us
          <br>Just a stranger on the bus, tryna make his way home
          <br>Just tryna make his way home, just like a holy rolling stone?
          <br>Back up to heaven all alone, just tryna make his way home
          <br>
          <br>[Outro]
          <br>Nobody calling on the phone
          <br>'Cept for the Pope, maybe in Rome
