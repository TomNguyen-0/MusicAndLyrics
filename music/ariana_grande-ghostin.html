          [Verse 1]
          <br>I know you hear me when I cry
          <br>I try to hold it in at night
          <br>While you're sleeping next to me
          <br>But it's your arms that I need this time (This time)
          <br>Look at the cards that we've been dealt
          <br>If you were anybody else
          <br>Probably wouldn't last a day
          <br>Every tear's a rain parade from hell (From hell)
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>Baby, you do it so well
          <br>You've been so understanding, you've been so good
          <br>And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
          <br>And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
          <br>Admit that it hurts you
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
          <br>Over him, mmh
          <br>I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
          <br>'Stead of ghostin' him
          <br>
          <br>[Post-Chorus]
          <br>We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
          <br>A whole lot of baggage
          <br>But I love you, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
          <br>A whole lot of baggage, oh yeah
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>Though I wish he were here instead
          <br>Don't want that living in your head
          <br>He just comes to visit me
          <br>When I'm dreaming every now and then (And then)
          <br>And after all that we been through (And after all that we been through)
          <br>There's so much to look forward to
          <br>What was done and what was said
          <br>Leave it all here in this bed with you (With you)
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>Baby, you do it so well
          <br>You've been so understanding, you've been so good
          <br>And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
          <br>And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
          <br>Admit that it hurts you, baby
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
          <br>Over him, mmh
          <br>I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
          <br>'Stead of ghostin' him
          <br>
          <br>[Post-Chorus]
          <br>We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with (Girl with)
          <br>A whole lot of baggage
          <br>But I love you (Love you), we'll get past this (Past this)
          <br>I'm a girl with a whole lot of baggage, yeah yeah
