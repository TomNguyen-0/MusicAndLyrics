        <p>
          It won't be easy
          <br>You'll think it's strange
          <br>When I try to explain how I feel
          <br>That I still need your love
          <br>After all that I've done
          <br>You won't believe me
          <br>All you will see
          <br>Is a girl you once knew
          <br>Although she's dressed up to the nines
          <br>At sixes and sevens with you
          <br>
          <br>I had to let it happen
          <br>I had to change
          <br>Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
          <br>Looking out of the window
          <br>Staying out of the sun
          <br>So I chose freedom
          <br>Running around trying everything new
          <br>But nothing impressed me at all
          <br>I never expected it to
          <br>
          <br>Don't cry for me Argentina
          <br>The truth is I never left you
          <br>All through my wild days
          <br>My mad existence
          <br>I kept my promise
          <br>Don't keep your distance
          <br>
          <br>And as for fortune and as for fame
          <br>I never invited them in
          <br>Though it seemed to the world
          <br>They were all I desired
          <br>They are illusions
          <br>They're not the solutions
          <br>They promise to be
          <br>The answer was here all the time
          <br>I love you and hope you love me
          <br>
          <br>Don't cry for me Argentina
          <br>
          <br>Don't cry for me Argentina
          <br>The truth is I never left you
          <br>All through my wild days
          <br>My mad existence
          <br>I kept my promise
          <br>Don't keep your distance
          <br>
          <br>Have I said too much?
          <br>There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
          <br>But all you have to do
          <br>Is look at me to know
          <br>That every word is true
          <br>
          <br>Don't cry for me Argentina
        </p>
