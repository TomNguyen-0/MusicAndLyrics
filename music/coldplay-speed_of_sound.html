        <p>
          How long before I get in?
          <br>Before it starts, before I begin?
          <br>How long before you decide?
          <br>Before I know what it feels like?
          <br>Where to, where do I go?
          <br>If you never try, then you'll never know
          <br>How long do I have to climb
          <br>Up on the side of this mountain of mine?
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>Look up, I look up at night
          <br>Planets are moving at the speed of light
          <br>Climb up, up in the trees
          <br>Every chance that you get
          <br>Is a chance you seize
          <br>How long am I gonna stand
          <br>With my head stuck under the sand?
          <br>I'll start before I can stop
          <br>Before I see things the right way up
          <br>
          <br>[Hook]
          <br>All that noise, and all that sound
          <br>All those places I got found
          <br>And birds go flying at the speed of sound
          <br>To show you how it all began
          <br>Birds came flying from the underground
          <br>If you could see it then you'd understand
          <br>[Verse 3]
          <br>Ideas that you'll never find
          <br>All the inventors could never design
          <br>The buildings that you put up
          <br>Japan and China all lit up
          <br>The sign that I couldn't read
          <br>Or a light that I couldn't see
          <br>Some things you have to believe
          <br>But others are puzzles, puzzling me
          <br>
          <br>[Hook]
          <br>All that noise, and all that sound
          <br>All those places I got found
          <br>And birds go flying at the speed of sound
          <br>To show you how it all began
          <br>Birds came flying from the underground
          <br>If you could see it then you'd understand
          <br>
          <br>Ah when you see it then you'll understand
          <br>
          <br>[Bridge]
          <br>All those signs, I knew what they meant
          <br>Some things you can invent
          <br>Some get made, and some get sent
          <br>
          <br>[Hook]
          <br>Birds go flying at the speed of sound
          <br>To show you how it all began
          <br>Birds came flying from the underground
          <br>If you could see it then you'd understand
          <br>Ah, when you see it then you'll understandPut lyrics here
