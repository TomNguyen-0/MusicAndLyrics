          [Hailee Steinfeld:]
          <br>You made plans and I, I made problems
          <br>We were sleeping back to back
          <br>We know this thing wasn't built to last
          <br>Good on paper, picture perfect
          <br>Chased the high too far, too fast
          <br>Picket white fence, but we paint it black
          <br>
          <br>Ooh, and I wished you would hurt me harder than I hurt you
          <br>Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me but you always do
          <br>
          <br>I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
          <br>Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I made
          <br>Someone you don't have to change
          <br>I've been hoping
          <br>Someone will love you, let me go
          <br>Someone will love you, let me go
          <br>I've been hoping
          <br>Someone will love you, let me go
          <br>
          <br>[Florida Georgia Line:]
          <br>Spend some time, but this time ain't even
          <br>I could leave it in the past but you're holding on to what you never had
          <br>Good on paper, picture perfect
          <br>Chased the high too far, too fast
          <br>Picket white fence, but we paint it black
          <br>

          <br>I've been hoping
          <br>Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
