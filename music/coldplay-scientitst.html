          [Verse 1]
<br>Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
<br>You don't know how lovely you are
<br>I had to find you, tell you I need you
<br>Tell you I set you apart
<br>Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
<br>Oh, let's go back to the start
<br>Running in circles, coming up tails
<br>Heads on a science apart
<br>
<br>[Chorus]
<br>Nobody said it was easy
<br>It's such a shame for us to part
<br>Nobody said it was easy
<br>No one ever said it would be this hard
<br>Oh, take me back to the start
<br>
<br>[Verse 2]
<br>I was just guessing at numbers and figures
<br>Pulling the puzzles apart
<br>Questions of science, science and progress
<br>Do not speak as loud as my heart
<br>Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
<br>Oh, and I rush to the start
<br>Running in circles, chasing our tails
<br>Coming back as we are
<br>[Chorus]
<br>Nobody said it was easy
<br>Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
<br>Nobody said it was easy
<br>No one ever said it would be so hard
<br>I'm going back to the start
<br>
<br>[Outro]
<br>Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
<br>Ah-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
<br>Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
<br>Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
