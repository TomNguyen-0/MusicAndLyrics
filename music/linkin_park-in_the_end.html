          One thing, I don't know why
          <br>It doesn't even matter how hard you try
          <br>Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
          <br>To explain in due time <div class="both">all I know
          </div>
          <br>Time is a valuable thing
          <br>Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
          <br>Watch it count down to the end of the day
          <br>The clock ticks life away, <div class="both">it's so unreal 
          </div>
          <br>Didn't look out below
          <br>Watch the time go right out the window
          <br>Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
          <br>I wasted it all just to <div class="both"> watch you go 
          </div>
          <br>I kept everything inside
          <br>And even though I tried, it all fell apart
          <br>What it meant to me will eventually be

          <br>In spite of the way you were mockin' me
          <br>Actin' like I was part of your property
