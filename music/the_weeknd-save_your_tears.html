Yeah
<br>I saw you dancing in a crowded room
<br>You look so happy when I'm not with you
<br>
<br>But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
<br>A single teardrop falling from your eye
<br>
<br>I don't know why I run away
<br>I'll make you cry when I run away
<br>
<br>You could have asked me why I broke your heart
<br>You could've told me that you fell apart
<br>But you walked past me like I wasn't there
<br>And just pretended like you didn't care
<br>
<br>I don't know why I run away
<br>I'll make you cry when I run away
<br>
<br>Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
<br>Save your tears for another
<br>Save your tears for another day
<br>Save your tears for another day
<br>
<br>So I made you think that I would always stay
<br>I said some things that I should never say
<br>Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
<br>And now you won't love me for a second time
<br>
<br>I don't know why I run away
<br>Oh girl, I make you cry when I run away
<br>
<br>Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
<br>Save your tears for another
<br>I realize that I'm much too late
<br>And you deserve someone better
<br>Save your tears for another day (ooh, yeah)
<br>Save your tears for another day (yeah)
<br>
<br>I don't know why I run away
<br>I'll make you cry when I run away
<br>
<br>Save your tears for another day, ooh girl (ah)
<br>I said save your tears for another day, yeah (ah)
<br>Save your tears for another day (ah)
<br>Save your tears for another day (ah)
