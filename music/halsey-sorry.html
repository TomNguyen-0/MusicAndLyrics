        <p>
          I've missed your calls for months it seems
          <br>Don't realize how mean I can be
          <br>'Cause I can sometimes treat the people
          <br>That I love like jewelry
          <br>'Cause I can change my mind each day
          <br>I didn't mean to try you on
          <br>But I still know your birthday
          <br>And your mother's favorite song
          <br>
          <br>So I'm sorry to my unknown lover
          <br>Sorry that I can't believe that anybody ever really
          <br>Starts to fall in love with me
          <br>Sorry to my unknown lover
          <br>Sorry I could be so blind
          <br>Didn't mean to leave you
          <br>And all of the things that we had behind
          <br>Ooh
          <br>Ooh
          <br>Ooh
          <br>
          <br>I run away when things are good
          <br>And never really understood
          <br>The way you laid your eyes on me
          <br>In ways that no one ever could
          <br>And so it seems I broke your heart
          <br>My ignorance has struck again
          <br>I failed to see it from the start
          <br>And tore you open 'til the end
          <br>
          <br>And I'm sorry to my unknown lover
          <br>Sorry that I can't believe that anybody ever really
          <br>Starts to fall in love with me
          <br>Sorry to my unknown lover
          <br>Sorry I could be so blind
          <br>Didn't mean to leave you
          <br>And all of the things that we had behind
          <br>
          <br>And someone will love you
          <br>Someone will love you
          <br>Someone will love you
          <br>But someone isn't me
          <br>Someone will love you
          <br>Someone will love you
          <br>Someone will love you
          <br>But someone isn't me
          <br>
          <br>Sorry to my unknown lover
          <br>Sorry that I can't believe that anybody ever really
          <br>Starts to fall in love with me
          <br>Sorry to my unknown lover
          <br>Sorry I could be so blind
          <br>Didn't mean to leave you
          <br>And all of the things that we had behind
          <br>
          <br>And someone will love you
          <br>Someone will love you
          <br>Someone will love you
          <br>But someone isn't me
          <br>And someone will love you
          <br>Someone will love you
          <br>Someone will love you
