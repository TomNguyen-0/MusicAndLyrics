            Man:
            <br>No more talk of darkness,
            <br>Forget these wide-eyed fears;
            <br>I'm here, nothing can harm you,
            <br>My words will warm and calm you.
            <br>
            <br>Man:
            <br>Let me be your freedom,
            <br>Let daylight dry your tears;
            <br>I'm here, with you, beside you,
            <br>To guard you and to guide you.
            <br>
            <br>Woman:
            <br>Say you love me every waking moment,
            <br>Turn my head with talk of summertime.
            <br>Say you need me with you now and always;
            <br>Promise me that all you say is true,
            <br>That's all I ask of you.
            <br>
            <br>Man:
            <br>Let me be your shelter,
            <br>Let me be your light;
            <br>You're safe, no one will find you,
            <br>Your fears are far behind you.
            <br>
            <br>Woman:
            <br>All I want is freedom,
            <br>A world with no more night;
            <br>And you, always beside me,
            <br>To hold me and to hide me.
            <br>
            <br>Man:
            <br>Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
            <br>Let me lead you from your solitude.
            <br>Say you need me with you, here beside you,
            <br>Anywhere you go, let me go too,
            <br>Christine, that's all I ask of you
            <br>
            <br>Woman:
            <br>Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
            <br>Say the word and I will follow you.
            <br>
            <br>Both:
            <br>Share each day with me,
            <br>Each night, each morning.
            <br>
            <br>Woman:
            <br>Say you love me!
            <br>
            <br>Man:
            <br>You know I do.
            <br>Both:
            <br>Love me, that's all I ask of you
            <br>
            <br>Anywhere you go, let me go too,
            <br>Love me, that's all I ask of you
