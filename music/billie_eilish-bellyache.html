        <p>
          Sitting all alone
          <br>Mouth full of gum
          <br>In the driveway
          <br>My friends aren't far
          <br>In the back of my car
          <br>Lay their bodies
          <br>
          <br>Where's my mind
          <br>Where's my mind
          <br>
          <br>They'll be here pretty soon
          <br>Looking through my room
          <br>For the money
          <br>I'm biting my nails
          <br>I'm too young to go to jail
          <br>It's kinda funny
          <br>
          <br>Where's my mind
          <br>Where's my mind
          <br>Where's my mind
          <br>Where's my mind
          <br>
          <br>Maybe it's in the gutter
          <br>Where I left my lover
          <br>What an expensive fake
          <br>My V is for Vendetta
          <br>Thought that I'd feel better
          <br>But now I got a bellyache
          <br>
          <br>Everything I do
          <br>The way I wear my noose
          <br>Like a necklace
          <br>I wanna make 'em scared
          <br>Like I could be anywhere
          <br>Like I'm reckless
          <br>
          <br>I lost my mind
          <br>I don't mind
          <br>Where's my mind
          <br>Where's my mind
          <br>
          <br>Maybe it's in the gutter
          <br>Where I left my lover
          <br>What an expensive fake
          <br>My V is for Vendetta
          <br>Thought that I'd feel better
          <br>But now I got a bellyache
          <br>
          <br>Maybe it's in the gutter
          <br>Where I left my lover
          <br>What an expensive fake
          <br>My V is for Vendetta
          <br>Thought that I'd feel better
          <br>And now I got a bellyache
        </p>
