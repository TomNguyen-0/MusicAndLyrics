        <p>
          You're fighting me off like a firefighter
          <br>So tell me why you still get burned
          <br>You say you're not, but you're still a liar
          <br>'Cause I'm the one that you run to first
          <br>
          <br>Every time, yeah, why do you try to deny it
          <br>When you show up every night
          <br>And tell me that you want me but it's complicated, so complicated
          <br>
          <br>When it hurts, but it hurts so good
          <br>Do you take it? Do you break it off?
          <br>When it hurts, but it hurts so good
          <br>Can you say it? Can you say it?
          <br>
          <br>Your love is like, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
          <br>Your love is like, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
          <br>It hurts so good, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
          <br>Your love is like, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
          <br>It hurts so good
          <br>
          <br>Every time that I swear it's over
          <br>It makes you want me even more
          <br>You pull away and I come in closer
          <br>And all we ever stay is torn
          <br>
          <br>Baby, I don't know why I try to deny it
          <br>When you show up every night
          <br>I tell you that I want you but it's complicated, so complicated
          <br>
          <br>When it hurts, but it hurts so good
          <br>Do you take it? Do you break it off?
          <br>When it hurts, but it hurts so good
          <br>Can you say it? Can you say it?
          <br>
          <br>Your love is like, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
          <br>Your love is like, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
          <br>It hurts so good, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
          <br>Your love is like, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
          <br>It hurts so good
          <br>
          <br>Wide awake through the daylight
          <br>Will you hold me like we're running a yellow light?
          <br>Reach for you with my hands tied
          <br>Are we dancing like we're burning in paradise?
          <br>
          <br>When it hurts, but it hurts so good
          <br>Do you take it? Do you break it off?
          <br>When it hurts, but it hurts so good
          <br>Can you say it? Can you say it?
          <br>
          <br>Your love is like, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
          <br>Your love is like, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
          <br>It hurts so good, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
          <br>Your love is like, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
          <br>It hurts so good
