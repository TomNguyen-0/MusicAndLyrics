        <p>
          Like a ghost don't need a key
          <br>Your best friend I've come to be
          <br>Please don't think of getting up for me
          <br>You don't even need to speak
          <br>
          <br>When I've been here for just one day
          <br>You'll already miss me if I go away
          <br>So close the blinds and shut the door
          <br>You won't need other friends anymore
          <br>
          <br>Oh don't leave home, oh don't leave home
          <br>
          <br>If you're cold I'll keep you warm
          <br>If you're low just hold on
          <br>'Cause I will be your safety
          <br>Oh don't leave home
          <br>
          <br>I arrived when you were weak
          <br>I'll make you weaker, like a child
          <br>Now all your love you give to me
          <br>When your heart is all I need
          <br>
          <br>Oh don't leave home, oh don't leave home
          <br>
          <br>If you're cold I'll keep you warm
          <br>If you're low just hold on
          <br>'Cause I will be your safety
          <br>Oh don't leave home
          <br>
          <br>Oh how quiet, quiet the world can be
          <br>When it's just you and little me
          <br>Everything is clear and everything is new
          <br>So you won't be leaving, will you?
          <br>
          <br>If you're cold I'll keep you warm
          <br>If you're low just hold on
          <br>'Cause I will be your safety
          <br>Oh don't leave home
          <br>
          <br>'Cause I will be your safety
          <br>And I will be your safety
          <br>And I will be your safety
          <br>Oh don't leave home
        </p>
