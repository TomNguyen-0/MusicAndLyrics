          [Verse 1]
          <br>I've been tryna call
          <br>I've been on my own for long enough
          <br>Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
          <br>I'mâ€…going through withdrawals
          <br>You don't even have to do too much
          <br>You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>I look around and
          <br>Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
          <br>No one's around to judge me (Oh)
          <br>I can't see clearly when you're gone
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
          <br>No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
          <br>I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
          <br>Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
          <br>Hey, hey, hey
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>I'm running out of time
          <br>'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
          <br>So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>The city's cold and empty (Oh)
          <br>No one's around to judge me (Oh)
          <br>I can't see clearly when you're gone
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
          <br>No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
          <br>I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
          <br>Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
          <br>
          <br>[Bridge]
          <br>I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
          <br>I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
          <br>Will never let you go this time (Ooh)
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
          <br>No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
          <br>Hey, hey, hey
          <br>Hey, hey, hey
          <br>
          <br>[Outro]
          <br>I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
          <br>No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
        </p>
