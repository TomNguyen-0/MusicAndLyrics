            When did we get so lost inside ourselves?
            <br>We used to be strong, now it's like we don't care
            <br>Instead we're calling out for help
            <br>Don't know where we went wrong, but it's so hard to share (so hard to share)
            <br>
            <br>All this weight left on our shoulders
            <br>Too much for the both of us
            <br>
            <br>When did it get so heavy?
            <br>This love that's in between us
            <br>It never used to feel this
            <br>Feels so heavy (heavy)
            <br>Can't get up off the ground (up off the ground)
            <br>It's weighing us down
            <br>
            <br>When did we get so bad at being honest?
            <br>You got things on your mind, that you don't wanna say
            <br>Thought that we had made a promise
            <br>That we would never get this way
            <br>
            <br>But all this weight left on our shoulders
            <br>Too much for the both of us
            <br>
            <br>When did it get so heavy?
            <br>This love that's in between us
            <br>It never used to feel this
            <br>Feels so heavy
            <br>Can't get up off the ground, yeah (up off the ground)
            <br>It's weighing us down
            <br>It's weighing us down (so heavy, baby)
            <br>
            <br>All these things we said that we never meant
            <br>Are we gonna let them hold us down?
            <br>All these things we said that we never meant
            <br>Are we gonna let them hold us down, down?
            <br>
            <br>'Cause baby it's too heavy
            <br>This love that's in between us
            <br>We never used to feel this
            <br>Feels so heavy, uh
            <br>Can't get up off the ground
            <br>Can't get up off the ground
            <br>It's weighing us down
            <br>It's weighing us down, down, down
            <br>
            <br>So heavy
            <br>It's weighing us down, down, down
            <br>No, no, no, no, na, na, na, na
            <br>So heavy
            <br>When did it get so, when did it get so heavy?
