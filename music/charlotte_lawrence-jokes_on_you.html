        <p>
          Drag me to death, like a lit cigarette
          <br>Took my last breath, like the smoke from my lips
          <br>I've lied for you, and I liked it too
          <br>But my knees are bruised, from kneelin' to you
          <br>I've had enough, but you're too hard to quit
          <br>We had our fun, now your sugar makes me sick
          <br>I've lied for you, and I liked it too
          <br>But my makeup's ruined
          <br>
          <br>And now I'm laughin' through my tears
          <br>I'm cryin' through my fear
          <br>But baby, if I had to choose
          <br>The joke's on you
          <br>
          <br>The joke's on you
          <br>
          <br>God knows I've tried to be kind
          <br>But I won't just lay down and die
          <br>Wearin' a fake smile
          <br>
          <br>The joke's on you
          <br>
          <br>My heart's gone bad, now it won't beat for you
          <br>You had your laugh, now I won't play the fool
          <br>I've lied for you, and I liked it too
          <br>But I'm black and blue, from bleedin' for you
          <br>You struck the match, burned me out so fast
          <br>Look what we had, now it's turned to ash
          <br>I've lied for you, and I liked it too
          <br>But my makeup's ruined
          <br>
          <br>And now I'm laughin' through my tears
          <br>I'm cryin' through my fear
          <br>But baby, if I had to choose
          <br>The joke's on you
          <br>
          <br>The joke's on you
          <br>
          <br>God knows I've tried to be kind
          <br>But I won't just lay down and die
          <br>Wearin' a fake smile
          <br>The joke's on you
        </p>
