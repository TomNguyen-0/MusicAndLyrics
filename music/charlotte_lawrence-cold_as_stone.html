        <p>
          I see it in your eyes, you're seconds from destroying me
          <br>I said my last goodbye, now someone get me out of here
          <br>Can't take another lie, stop telling me who I should be
          <br>'Cause I don't wanna go where you're going
          <br>You're telling me I can't change my mind
          <br>
          <br>So I'm cold as stone
          <br>The only way I know
          <br>To keep my soul
          <br>And never let it show
          <br>That I don't really know what I'm doing
          <br>But all I know is I'm crashing down
          <br>
          <br>So let me, let me out
          <br>I can't love you anymore
          <br>Let me, let me out
          <br>I don't love you like before
          <br>
          <br>Let me, let me
          <br>I don't love you
          <br>Let me, let me
          <br>
          <br>Never felt so lonely, there you standing next to me
          <br>I always feel so empty when you promise you won't leave
          <br>Every time you hold me I run away so I can breathe
          <br>You can't even hear me when I'm screaming
          <br>Try to stay away out of line
          <br>
          <br>So I'm cold as stone
          <br>The only way I know
          <br>To keep my soul
          <br>And never let it show
          <br>I'm cold as stone
          <br>
          <br>So let me, let me out
          <br>I can't love you anymore
          <br>Let me, let me out
          <br>I don't love you like before
          <br>
          <br>Let me, let me
          <br>I don't love you
          <br>Let me, let me
          <br>
          <br>I was burying my heart on my seat
          <br>Before I used to be down on my knees
          <br>It's funny how clearly I see
          <br>I was trying not so desperately
          <br>
          <br>So let me, let me out
          <br>I can't love you anymore
          <br>Let me, let me out
          <br>I don't love you like before
          <br>So let me, let me out
          <br>I can't love you anymore
          <br>Let me, let me out
          <br>I don't love you like before
          <br>
          <br>Let me, let me
          <br>I don't love you
          <br>Let me, let me
          <br>I don't love you like before
          <br>Let me, let me
          <br>I don't love you
          <br>Let me, let me
          <br>I don't love you like before
