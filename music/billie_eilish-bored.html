          The games you played were never fun
          <br>You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run
          <br>
          <br>Giving you what you're begging for
          <br>Giving you what you say I need
          <br>I don't want any settled scores
          <br>I just want you to set me free
          <br>Giving you what you're begging for
          <br>Giving you what you say I need, say I need
          <br>
          <br>I'm not afraid anymore
          <br>What makes you sure you're all I need?
          <br>Forget about it
          <br>When you walk out the door and leave me torn
          <br>You're teaching me to live without it
          <br>Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
          <br>
          <br>I'm home alone, you're God knows where
          <br>I hope you don't think that shit's fair
          <br>
          <br>Giving you all you want and more
          <br>Giving you every piece of me
          <br>I don't want love I can't afford
          <br>I just want you to love for free
          <br>Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
          <br>Giving you every piece of me, piece of me
          <br>
          <br>I'm not afraid anymore
          <br>What makes you sure you're all I need?
          <br>Forget about it
          <br>When you walk out the door and leave me torn
          <br>You're teaching me to live without it
          <br>I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
          <br>
          <br>Giving you what you're begging for
          <br>Giving you what you say I need
          <br>I don't want any settled scores
          <br>I just want you to set me free
          <br>Giving you what you're begging for
          <br>Giving you what you say I need, say I need
          <br>
          <br>I'm not afraid anymore
          <br>What makes you sure you're all I need?
          <br>Forget about it
          <br>And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
          <br>You're teaching me to live without it
