          Oh, oh, oh
          <br>Oh,  oh, oh
          <br>Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 1]
          <br>We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
          <br>I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
          <br>I  couldn't be there even when I tried
          <br>You  don't believe it, we do this every time
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>Seasons change and our love went cold
          <br>Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
          <br>Run away, but we're running in circles
          <br>Run away, run away
          <br>I dare you to do something
          <br>I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
          <br>Run away, but we're running in circles
          <br>Run away, run away, run away
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
          <br>I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
          <br>You thought that it was special, special
          <br>But it was just the sex though, the sex though
          <br>And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
          <br>I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>Seasons change and our love went cold
          <br>Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
          <br>Run away, but we're running in circles
          <br>Run away, run away
          <br>I dare you to do something
          <br>I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
          <br>Run away, but we're running in circles
          <br>Run away, run away, run away
          <br>
          <br>[Bridge]
          <br>Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
          <br>It's only me, what you got to lose?
          <br>Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
          <br>It's only me, let it go
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>Seasons change and our love went cold
          <br>Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
          <br>Run away, but we're running in circles
          <br>Run away, run away
          <br>I dare you to do something
          <br>I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
          <br>Run away, but we're running in circles
          <br>Run away, run away, run away
