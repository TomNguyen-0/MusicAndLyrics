        <p>
  It doesn't mean much
<br>It doesn't mean anything at all
<br>The life I've left behind me is a cold room
<br>
<br>I've crossed the last line
<br>From where I can't return
<br>Where every step I took in faith betrayed me
<br>And led me from my home
<br>
<br>And sweet surrender
<br>Is all that I have to give
<br>
<br>Take me in, no question's asked
<br>You strip away the ugliness that surrounds me
<br>(Who are you?)
<br>Are you an angel?
<br>
<br>Am I already that gone?
<br>I only hope that I won't disappoint you
<br>When I'm down here on my knees
<br>(Who are you?)
<br>
<br>And sweet surrender
<br>Is all that I have to give
<br>(Who are you?)
<br>
<br>And sweet surrender
<br>Is all that I have to give
<br>
<br>Don't understand
<br>The touch of your hand
<br>I would be the one to fall
<br>I miss the little things
<br>I miss everything about you
<br>
<br>Doesn't mean much
<br>It doesn't mean anything at all
<br>The life I left behind me is a cold room
<br>(Who are you?)
<br>
<br>And sweet surrender
<br>Is all that I have to give
<br>(Who are you?)
<br>
<br>And sweet surrender
<br>Is all that I have to give
        </p>
