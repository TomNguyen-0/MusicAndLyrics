        <p>
          [Verse 1]
          <br>I haven't ever really found a place that I call home
          <br>I never stick around quite long enough to make it
          <br>I apologize that once again I'm not in love
          <br>But it's not as if I mind that your heart ain't exactly breaking
          <br>It's just a thought, only a thought
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>But if my life is for rent
          <br>And I don't learn to buy
          <br>Well I deserve nothing more than I get
          <br>'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>I've always thought that I would love to live by the sea
          <br>To travel the world alone and live more simply
          <br>I have no idea what's happened to that dream
          <br>'Cause there's really nothing left here to stop me
          <br>It's just a thought, only a thought
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>If my life is for rent
          <br>And I don't learn to buy
          <br>Well I deserve nothing more than I get
          <br>'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
          <br>If my life is for rent
          <br>And I don't learn to buy
          <br>Well I deserve nothing more than I get
          <br>'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
          <br>[Bridge]
          <br>While my heart is a shield and I won't let it down
          <br>While I am so afraid to fail so I won't even try
          <br>Well, how can I say I'm alive?
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>If my life is for rent
          <br>And I don't learn to buy
          <br>Well I deserve nothing more than I get
          <br>'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
          <br>If my life is for rent
          <br>And I don't learn to buy
          <br>Well I deserve nothing more than I get
          <br>'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
          <br>
          <br>[Outro]
          <br>'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
          <br>'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
          <br>'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
        </p>
