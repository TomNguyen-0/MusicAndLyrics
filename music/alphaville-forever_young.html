        <p>
          Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
          <br>Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
          <br>Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
          <br>Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
          <br>
          <br>Let us die young or let us live forever
          <br>We don't have the power but we never say never
          <br>Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
          <br>The music's for the sad men
          <br>
          <br>Can you imagine when this race is won
          <br>Turn our golden faces into the sun
          <br>Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
          <br>The music's played by the, the mad man
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>Forever young, I want to be forever young
          <br>Do you really want to live forever?
          <br>Forever, and ever
          <br>Forever young, I want to be forever young
          <br>Do you really want to live forever?
          <br>Forever young
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>Some are like water, some are like the heat
          <br>Some are a melody and some are the beat
          <br>Sooner or later, they all will be gone
          <br>Why don't they stay young
          <br>
          <br>It's so hard to get old without a cause
          <br>I don't want to perish like a fading horse
          <br>Youth's like diamonds in the sun
          <br>And diamonds are forever
          <br>
          <br>So many adventures couldn't happen today
          <br>So many songs we forgot to play
          <br>So many dreams swinging out of the blue
          <br>We let them come true
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>Forever young, I want to be forever young
          <br>Do you really want to live forever?
          <br>Forever, and ever
          <br>Forever young, I want to be forever young
          <br>Do you really want to live forever?
          <br>Forever, and ever
          <br>
          <br>[Outro]
          <br>Forever young, I want to be forever young
          <br>Do you really want to live forever? Forever young
        </p>
