        <p>
            I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls
            <br>With vassals and serfs at my side
            <br>And of all who assembled within those walls
            <br>That I was the hope and the pride
            <br>I had riches all too great to count
            <br>And a high ancestral name
            <br>
            <br>But I also dreamt which pleased me most
            <br>That you loved me still the same
            <br>That you loved me
            <br>You loved me still the same
            <br>That you loved me
            <br>You loved me still the same
            <br>
            <br>I dreamt that suitors sought my hand
            <br>That knights upon bended knee
            <br>And with vows no maidens heart could withstand
            <br>They pledged their faith to me
            <br>And I dreamt that one of that noble host
            <br>Came forth my hand to claim
            <br>
            <br>But I also dreamt which charmed me most
            <br>That you loved me still the same
            <br>That you loved me
            <br>You loved me still the same
            <br>That you loved me
            <br>You loved me still the same        </p>
