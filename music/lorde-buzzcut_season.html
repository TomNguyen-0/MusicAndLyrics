        <p>
          I remember when your head caught flame
          <br>It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
          <br>(I remember when your head caught flame)
          <br>Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay
          <br>It's buzzcut season, anyway
          <br>(Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay)
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>Explosions on TV
          <br>And all the girls with heads inside a dream
          <br>So now we live beside the pool
          <br>Where everything is good
          <br>
          <br>[Verse 2]
          <br>We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
          <br>People should see how we're living
          <br>(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
          <br>Shut my eyes to the song that plays
          <br>Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
          <br>(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>The men up on the news
          <br>They try to tell us all that we will lose
          <br>But it's so easy in this blue
          <br>Where everything is good
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>And I'll never go home again
          <br>(Place the call, feel it start)
          <br>Favourite friend
          <br>(And nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
          <br>I live in a hologram with you
          <br>We're all the things that we do for fun
          <br>(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
          <br>Play along
          <br>(Make-believe it's hyper real)
          <br>But I live in a hologram with you
          <br>
          <br>[Bridge]
          <br>Cola with the burnt-out taste
          <br>I'm the one you tell your fears to
          <br>There'll never be enough of us
          <br>
          <br>[Pre-Chorus]
          <br>Explosions on TV
          <br>And all the girls with heads inside a dream
          <br>So now we live beside the pool
          <br>Where everything is good
          <br>
          <br>[Chorus]
          <br>And I'll never go home again
          <br>(Place the call, feel it start)
          <br>Favourite friend
          <br>(And nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
          <br>I live in a hologram with you
          <br>We're all the things that we do for fun
          <br>(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
          <br>Play along
          <br>(Make-believe it's hyper real)
          <br>But I live in a hologram with you
          <br>
