        <p>
          There were nights when the wind was so cold
          <br>That my body froze in bed
          <br>If I just listened to it right outside the window
          <br>
          <br>There were days when the sun was so cruel
          <br>That all the tears turned to dust
          <br>And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever
          <br>
          <br>I finished crying in the instant that you left
          <br>And I can't remember where or when or how
          <br>And I banished every memory you and I had ever made
          <br>
          <br>But when you touch me like this
          <br>And you hold me like that
          <br>I just have to admit
          <br>That it's all coming back to me
          <br>It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now
          <br>
          <br>There were moments of gold
          <br>And there were flashes of light
          <br>There were things I'd never do again
          <br>But then they'd always seemed right
          <br>There were nights of endless pleasure
          <br>It was more than any laws allowed
          <br>
          <br>Baby, baby, baby
          <br>
          <br>When you touch me like this
          <br>And when you hold me like that
          <br>It was gone with the wind
          <br>But it's all coming back to me
          <br>
          <br>I can barely recall
          <br>But its all coming back to me now
        </p>
